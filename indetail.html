						<h2>The shoulder</h2>
						<p> The first detailed piece of the picture is the woman's shoulder. As you can see there are a few hearst representing her possible feeling.</p>
						<p> Their pink color emphasizes the hearts on the picture and the feeling as a result and really draws some attention to it.</p>
						<p> This little element, even though might seem insignificant, has a huge meaning in the idea of this piece.</p>
						<p> It represents not just the kiss, but the love of two people who are together. Their deep connection.</p>

						<h2>The lips</h2>
						<p> The second and last huglighted element of the painting are the lips of the woman. </p>
						<p> We again see the same pink color that was used with the heatrs shown above.</p>
						<p> The same way, as and the hearts, the lips grab audience's attention to something bright and warm on the black and white picture.</p>
						<p> The lips reprent passion and tenderness that people, particularly woman, feels to her partner. They represent love. </p>

						<h2>The faces</h2>
						<p> The last but not least detail of the painting is the faces and what they represent. </p>
						<p> From the first point of view you might not even notice the meaning and importance if this detail.</p>
						<p> However, they are worth looking at and talking about. As they located so close to each other, and we can see that both partner's eyes are closed, despite the black and white colors we feel warm and deep relationships.</p>
						<p> The faces are one more detail in the painting which adds to the whole picture of love. </p>
